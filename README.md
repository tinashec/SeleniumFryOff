# SeleniumFryOff
This Selenium repo automates user interaction with the bacon fryoff page from Colcom. 

Colcom ran an online competition to promote the new look on its range of Bacon products. The competition sought user interaction for as long as possible.
Using Selenium, this repo automates the user interactions. More information can be found on my blog, www.tinashechinyanga.co.zw
